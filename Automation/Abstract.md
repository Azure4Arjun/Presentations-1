# Automating routine tasks for the SQL Server data professional

### Abstract
Do you want to install a new SQL Server instance in less time than it takes to get a latte at Starbucks?

I've worked on teams managing hundreds of SQL Server instances, and tens of thousands of databases. I've also been the lone DBA, managing all thing SQL Server with nobody around to help. In both these cases, automation is critical to ensure you can be productive and keep the lights on. It doesn't matter what scale you work on--if you're interested in using automation to eliminate routine tasks, this session is for you.

In this session, we'll walk through the reasons you need to automate, the process you should use in determining what tasks *you* need to automate, and how I approach the automation itself--including picking the right tool for the job. Then we'll dig into some code.
