# Blazing performance through better indexing

### Abstract
I spent 10 years as a DBA tuning a wide array of high-volume OLTP database environments. Knowing how to use indexing effectively has been the most important skill to keep those systems running fast and efficiently. Using the right index for the right scenario can be the "go fast" button that keeps queries and customers happy.

If you are a DBA or T-SQL Developer, this seminar is for you. In this full-day seminar, I will share my index-tuning knowledge with you, so that you can become an index tuning master. We will spend the first half of the day learning about the many flavors of indexes, dipping our toes into index internals so that we can truly understand their costs and benefits. After lunch, we will move on to some practical applications: How and when to use different indexing tools, index and statistics maintenance, indexing best practices, and how to make sure you have enough--but not too many--indexes for your workload.


### Course Outline:
* Indexes vs Heaps
* Picking the best PK
* Rowstore vs Columnstore compression
* How many Indexes do you need?
* Compression, filtering, and partitioning, oh my!
* Index & Stats Maintenance: Why rebuilding indexes isn't always the right answer
* Putting indexes to work with some performance tuning examples
